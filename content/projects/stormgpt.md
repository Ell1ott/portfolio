# StormGPT - AI-Powered Creative Brainstorming

ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek - they all share a common limitation: they’re linear. One prompt, one response. A back-and-forth that mimics conversation, but not cognition.

But that’s not how the human mind works - especially not during brainstorming. Our thoughts diverge, loop back, cross-pollinate. Ideas spark tangents, which grow into entirely new threads.

That’s where the idea for StormGPT was born.

StormGPT breaks free from the one-dimensional confines of traditional chat interfaces. Instead of a single stream, it opens up a multi-branched space to think, iterate, and explore in parallel. It's a dynamic canvas for ideation—where thoughts can split, evolve, and converge, just like real brainstorming.

With StormGPT, we’re not just talking to AI—we’re thinking with it.

## The early beginnings

StormGPT is still in its earliest stages. So far, my focus has been on refining the core concept—making sure the foundation is solid. Alongside that, I’ve started exploring the design of the user interface and experience: how it should feel, look, and function.

Initial sketches and design mockups have been created to explore different UI layouts and user flows. These early concepts experiment with node-based thinking, spatial interfaces.

Below are some of the sketches and early design ideas that guided our thinking:

Based of these sketches i then created some designs:
